        "floral_language": "Helianthus annuus\nFloriogrphy: sunny, warm, and optimistic.\n\nThe name sunflower may derive from the fact that shape of the flower's head resembles the sun, or from the false impression that the blooming plant appears to slowly turn its flower towards the sun as the latter moves across the sky on a daily basis. Generally, there is only a single large golden inflorescence atop an unbranched stem like a small sun. The outer flowers, ray flowers, attract pollinators. The tubiform florets in the center of the flower head, disk flowers, mature into edible fruits (sunflower seeds).\n\nSunflower prefers sunny areas. The flower can grow in any season, however, summer and winter are better. Blooming period is short, lasting for two through three weeks.",
